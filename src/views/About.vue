      <p class="lead">
        A volcano is a mountain or hill that has an opening through which gaseous,
        liquid or solid materials can escape from inside the earth. A volcano is a
        fissure in the earth's crust on which a cone of solid, molten matter accumulates
        and is thrown through the chimney from inside the Earth. At the top of this cone
        is a concave formation called a crater. When activity occurs in a volcano, the volcano
        is said to be erupting.

      <p class="lead">
        Volcanoes are generally structures composed of fragmented material and lava flows.
        Molten rock that comes from the earth's mantle comes out through the chimney, which is
        known as magma. Once magma rises to the surface, it loses the gases it contains because
        it evaporates, and as it runs down the slopes of the cone it is known as lava. This cone
        is formed by successive solidified layers, all inclined towards the outside of the chimney.
