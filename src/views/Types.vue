                      They are large and have a conical shape with a central crater,
                      the volcanic building is formed by successive layers of lava deposits
                      and rock fragments: slag, sand and ash, the product of different
                      eruptions. For this reason they are called compound. These volcanoes
                      often form impressive snow-capped peaks that are greater than 2,500
                      meters (8.6 miles) in height, 1,000 (621 miles) square kilometers in
                      surface, and 400 kilometers (249 cubic miles) in volume. Composite
                      volcanoes erupt explosively from viscous magma. When magma is very
                      viscous, it rises to the surface, but it clogs the crater and the gas
                      is trapped. Therefore, the pressure will increase and result in an explosive
                      eruption. These volcanoes are located along the subduction zones.

                      Shield volcanoes are huge in size. They are made up of many layers
                      of lava flows. Lava spills out of a central vent or group of vents.
                      It forms a fairly wide cone. It is caused by basaltic lava, which is
                      very fluid, and cannot pile up in steep places. Shield volcanoes can be
                      produced by hot spots that are far from the edges of tectonic plates.
                      They also occur along the mid-oceanic ridge, where seafloor expansion
                      is ongoing, and around areas of subduction related to volcanic arcs.
                      Shield volcano eruptions are characterized by low-explosive lava that
                      forms cinder cones and cones on the vents.

                      They are relatively small cones that, as their name indicates, are formed
                      by the accumulation of ash and slag. An cinder cone is a steep conical
                      hill formed above a vent. Cinder cones are some of the most common volcanic
                      formations found in the world. They are not very famous, as their eruptions
                      generally do not cause any loss of life. Cinder cones are primarily made up
                      of strombolian eruptions, which occur when magma is viscous, and the
                      trapped gas intermittently escapes as it rises to the surface. This often
                      results in blocks and bombs falling on the surrounding environment.
                      Cones usually grow in groups and occur on the slopes of volcanoes and
                      stratum-shield volcanoes.
                      Cinder cones are built from fragments of lava called ashes. Lava fragments
                      are expelled from a single vent and accumulate around the vent as they fall
                      back to earth. Cinder cones grow rapidly and approach their maximum size in
                      a short time. These rarely exceed 250 meters (820 feet) in height and 500
                      meters (1,640 feet) in diameter. Its form can be modified during its (short)
                      life. A great example of a cinder cone is the Paricut√≠n in Mexico
